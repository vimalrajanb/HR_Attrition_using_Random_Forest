# HR_Attrition_using_Random_Forest
In this HR Attrition Prediction project, I embarked on a journey to tackle the challenge of predicting employee attrition within an organization. The project commenced with thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, ensuring that my dataset was in optimal condition for model training. Initially, I constructed a predictive model using a single Decision Tree, which served as my baseline. However, recognizing the potential for improved accuracy and robustness, I proceeded to implement the Random Forest algorithm. Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees, and it delivered notably superior results compared to the single Decision Tree. Through rigorous evaluation and comparison of both models, I observed that Random Forest significantly outperformed the baseline model, demonstrating its effectiveness in HR attrition prediction. This project showcases the power of ensemble methods in enhancing predictive accuracy and underscores the importance of model selection in machine learning tasks.
